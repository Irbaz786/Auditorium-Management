"My Python-Django based project encompasses both an admin and user interface. On the user side, it includes key pages such as the home page, appointment page, feedback page, login, and registration page. These pages incorporate various JavaScript validations, including validations for time and date inputs. Users can input data, which is then displayed, and their requests can be approved or denied. Additionally, users have the ability to download data in Excel format and receive feedback via email.

On the admin side, all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are available. Admins can approve or reject user requests and manage user data efficiently."
